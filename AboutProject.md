1. Self-Service
Self-Service portals provide end-users with a way to:

Log incidents (e.g., report issues with software or hardware).
Raise service requests (e.g., request new software or access to a tool).
Track the status of existing incidents or requests.
Search knowledge articles or FAQs for common solutions to problems.
Access automated virtual agents for help. 
Use Case:
End-users can raise incidents without contacting the IT help desk, reducing workload on support teams and speeding up issue resolution.

2. Incidents
In ServiceNow, Incidents refer to any unplanned disruptions to services or degradation in service quality. Managing incidents is a core function of IT Service Management (ITSM).

Example: A user cannot access email or the internet, and an incident is created to restore service.
Incident Management Workflow:

Create: The incident is logged.
Assign: The incident is assigned to the relevant team.
Investigate: The root cause is identified.
Resolve: The service is restored.
Close: The incident is marked resolved or closed.
3. Watched Incidents
These are incidents that a user is tracking or monitoring for updates, even if the user is not directly assigned to them. Watching incidents helps stay informed about progress or changes to critical incidents.

Use Case:

A manager or IT lead might watch incidents that are critical to their department.
Teams that rely on another service might track related incidents to be aware of updates or potential delays.
4. Service Desk
The Service Desk serves as the central point of contact between users and the IT department. Its key responsibilities include:

Receiving, logging, and assigning incidents.
Resolving simple issues directly or routing complex problems to the correct teams.
Providing support and tracking service requests.
Use Case:
If an employee reports a laptop issue, the service desk logs the incident and assigns it to the hardware support team.

5. Incident Categories
Below is a detailed explanation of the different Incident views mentioned:

a) Incident
This refers to the full list of all incidents, regardless of status. It is typically available to administrators and managers to view all incidents across the system.

b) Create New
Allows users or IT personnel to log a new incident. When creating a new incident, the following information is usually required:

Short Description (e.g., "Unable to access email").
Category (e.g., Network, Software).
Priority (e.g., High, Medium, Low).
Assignment Group or Assigned To.
c) Assigned to me
This view displays all incidents assigned to the logged-in user. The person assigned to the incident is responsible for resolving the issue.

Use Case:
A technician logs into ServiceNow, sees the list of incidents assigned to them, and begins working on the most critical one.

d) Open
This list shows all incidents that are not yet resolved or closed. It typically includes incidents with statuses like "In Progress" or "On Hold."

Use Case:
The service desk monitors open incidents to ensure timely resolution and prevent SLA breaches.

e) Open - Unassigned
This view shows incidents that are open but not yet assigned to any specific individual or team.

Use Case:
A service desk manager reviews this list to assign incidents to the appropriate team or technician.

f) Resolved
This list shows incidents that are resolved but not yet closed. After confirming with the user that the issue is resolved, the technician can move the incident to the closed state.

Use Case:
If a user still has the issue after the resolution, they can re-open the incident, ensuring the problem is properly resolved.

g) All
This view provides access to all incidents, regardless of their status (Open, Closed, In Progress, etc.).

Use Case:
Administrators or managers can use this view for reporting, auditing, or reviewing incident trends over time.

6. Task SLA
This section monitors Service Level Agreements (SLAs) for tasks, including incidents. It tracks how well the IT team is performing against agreed timeframes.

Use Case: Ensures incidents are resolved within specified SLAs, such as:
Priority 1 incidents must be resolved within 4 hours.
Priority 2 incidents must be resolved within 24 hours.
The Task SLA allows users to:

View active and breached SLAs.
Monitor performance of teams and individuals.
Escalate issues nearing breach deadlines.
7. Overview
The Overview section provides a dashboard view of incidents and SLAs. This can include:

Total incidents: Open, Resolved, Closed.
Incidents by priority: High, Medium, Low.
SLA Performance: Percentage of incidents resolved within SLA.
Graphs and metrics: Help managers quickly identify problem areas.
Use Case:
Managers use the Overview Dashboard to:

Monitor the workload and backlog of incidents.
Track the performance of their team.
Identify patterns in incidents (e.g., recurring network outages).
Summary of Key Use Cases
Self-Service Portal: Enables users to log incidents and requests on their own.

Service Desk: Acts as the primary point of contact for users needing IT assistance.
Task SLA: Ensures compliance with service timelines, avoiding penalties or breaches.
